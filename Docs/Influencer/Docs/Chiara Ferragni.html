        <h1><font size = "5">Her Story</font></h1>
        <p><font face = "Verdana"><font size = "4"><font color= "red"><center>Ferragni was born in Cremona in 1987. She started her fashion blog "The Blonde Salad" in October 2009, with a former boyfriend, Riccardo Pozzoli. In March 2011, New York introduced her as "One of the biggest breakout street-style stars of the year". In December 2011, she was profiled as the Blogger of the Moment in Teen Vogue, while still a law student at Bocconi University . She has not obtained her University degree. By that time Ferragni's blog had reached more than one million unique visitors and 12 million views per month. By 2013, she had won various blogger of the year recognitions. In December 2013, she published an Italian language eBook, under The Blonde Salad.

Ferragni modelled for Guess in a November 2013 shoot that was subsequently marketed as an ad campaign. In December 2013 she collaborated with Steve Madden to design a 9-shoe collection for Spring 2014.

Her television credits include the Italian TRL Awards as a presenter, and a guest appearance on the Italian variety show Chiambretti Night. Ferragni walked the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival in conjunction with the premiere of We Have a Pope (then titled Habemus Papam). She also appeared on Project Runway as a guest judge during season 13 in August 2014.

Her business ventures grossed about $8 million (mostly from her Chiara Ferragni Collection footwear) in 2014.

In January 2015, her blog and shoe line, Chiara Ferragni Collection, became a case study at Harvard Business School. In March, Ferragni was selected for the cover of the April 2015 Vogue Espa√±a, making her the first fashion blogger to appear on any Vogue cover. Since then she has appeared on over 50 fashion magazines covers. In January 2016, Pantene announced Ferragni was its new global ambassador. Mattel Inc. created a Barbie version of Ferragni in September 2016, one wearing a white T-shirt, black leather jacket, jeans and Chiara Ferragni Collection shoes and the other wearing a head to toe Chanel look.

As of 31 July 2017, Ferragni had 10 million followers on Instagram. Because of her broad following, she was able to earn about $12,000 for a sponsored post to Instagram.

In 2017, Ferragni was chosen to design costumes for the 4th edition of Intimissimi on ice. On 26 July 2017, she opened her first Chiara Ferragni Collection store in Milan. In May 2018, Footwear News named her one of "the most influential moms in the fashion industry".</font></font></font></center></p>
